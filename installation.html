    <h2 id="configuring_connections">Configuring Connections</h2>


    <p>When starting andFHEM the first time some dummy data is used for previewing what the application looks like and
        what devices are supported. To use your own FHEM server click on the selector in the action bar. This selector
        always contains the name of the connection that is currently used for pulling data from a FHEM server.</p>

    <a href="../images/installation/connectionType.png"><img src="../images/installation/connectionType.png"/></a>

    <p>After clicking the selector a submenu opens. This submenu contains all configured connections. When clicking a
        connection name, the current connection used for pulling information from FHEM changes to that new one. When
        selecting the bottom item, which is called "Manage" or "Verwalten", you are directed to a view where you can
        manage your connections.</p>

    <a href="../images/installation/connectionList.png"><img src="../images/installation/connectionList.png"/></a>

    <p>All the configured connections are listed here. When clicking such a connection, you can edit all configured
        connection items like URL, username or password. When clicking "Create a new connection" or "Neue Verbindung
        erstellen", you can create a new one.</p>

    <p>Changing a configuration or adding a new one always looks the same, except that you cannot change the connection
        type when editing a connection.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top"><a href="../images/installation/fhemweb.png"><img
                    src="../images/installation/fhemweb.png"/></a></td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top"><a href="../images/installation/telnet.png"><img
                    src="../images/installation/telnet.png"/></a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Enter your credentials and click "Save" or "Speichern". When leaving the configuration view with the back key and
        reentering the collection list selector, you can select your newly created connection.</p>

    <h2 id="fhemweb">FHEMWEB</h2>


    <p>FHEM supports some web interfaces delivered together with the server itself. One of these web interfaces is
        FHEMWEB, which is configured by adding a line like <span class="code">define fhemweb FHEMWEB 8083 global</span>
        to your <i>fhem.cfg</i>. Before any data within andFHEM, make sure that you can access the web interface in a
        browser, either on your smartphone or on another computer. You should see a web page like the following:</p>

    <img src="../images/installation/fhemweb_view.png"/>

    <p>The same address you just entered is expected by andFHEM in the URL field within the FHEMWEB preferences.
        Trailing slashes do not matter. The username and password fields can be filled optionally. They are required if
        you want to authenticate yourself using basic authentication. If you do not know what this means, stop reading
        here and leave the fields empty. </p>

    <p>If you want to use the authentication feature you have to make sure that your fhem.cfg contains a line like <span
            class="code">attr fhemweb basicAuth aj38219cnake</span>. For information how to create the string after
        basicAuth, continue reading here. Now just enter your username and password in andFHEM.</p>

    <h2 id="telnet">Telnet</h2>


    <p>FHEM supports a very basic command line interface to query the current state of devices. Before selecting this
        option, make sure that you can access the interface from another computer in your local network.</p>

    <p>When using Windows, download Putty and start the program. Select telnet as connection option, enter the address
        of your FHEM server and add the specified port in your FHEM configuration. The port defaults to 7072. When
        clicking hitting the button to open the connection, a black window opens up. Hit two times enter to see the FHEM
        prompt showing up. If this works, andFHEM is also able to connect to FHEM.</p>

    <p>If not, make sure that your fhem.cfg contains a line such as the following: attr global port 7072 global. 7072 is
        the port used for opening up the command line interface. Global specifies that computers can connect to the
        server without connecting from the computer running the FHEM server.</p>

    <p>When the above connection is successful you can enter the configuration data in andFHEM in the appropriate
        fields. The IP field should contain something like 192.168.0.1. It is the address of the computer running the
        FHEM server. Port is the above mentioned FHEM command line interface port, such as 7072.</p>

    <h2 id="gcm">Google Cloud Messaging</h2>


    <p>Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) enables you to send push notifications to Android handsets. This enables you to send
        updates in nearly realtime to andFHEM (from 2.4.2 onwards).</p>

    <p><b>Installation Steps:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Download and install the <a href="http://svn.code.sf.net/p/fhem/code/trunk/fhem/contrib/98_gcmsend.pm">98_gcmsend.pm</a>
            module for FHEM (copy the file to the FHEM directory, make sure that your Perl installation meets all the
            dependencies. FHEM will tell you if it can load the module, especially when issuing <span class="code">reload 98_gcmsend</span>.
            You can also copy the file from the <span class="code">contrib</span> directory. If doing so, don't forget
            to modify the file permissions of <span class="code">98_gcmsend.pm</span> (the user running FHEM has to be
            able to read the file, so change the owner using <span class="code">chown fhem 98_gcmsend.pm</span> or give
            all users the permission to read the file using <span class="code">chmod a+r 98_gcmsend.pm</span>) <br/>
            The module depends on two perl modules, which have to be installed to
            <i>fhem/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.12.2/</i> (on FritzBoxes, otherwise choose your perl directory)
            <ul>

                            src="../images/installation/FritzBoxHttps.png"/></a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Create a Google GCM Account.
            <ul>
                <li>Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://console.firebase.google.com">https://console.firebase.google.com</a>
                    and create a new project. <br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/1.png"><img src="../images/installation/gcm/1.png"/></a>
                </li>
                <li>Enter the required project details. <br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/2.png"><img src="../images/installation/gcm/2.png"/></a>
                </li>
                <li>Hit the gear button and jump to project settings.<br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/3.png"><img src="../images/installation/gcm/3.png"/></a>
                </li>
                <li>Select cloud messaging. This page contains our required server key ("api key") and the required
                    sender id ("project number") <br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/4.png"><img src="../images/installation/gcm/4.png"/></a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Now we create a GCM device. Issue <span class="code">define &lt;gcm_device_name&gt; gcmsend</span> within
            your FHEM instance.
        </li>
        <li>Afterwards we need to configure the device to talk to GCM. This is why we have to issue another FHEM
            command: <br/>
            <span class="code">attr &lt;gcm_device_name&gt; apiKey &lt;apiKey&gt;</span><br/>
            whereas <span class="code">&lt;gcm_device_name&gt;</span> is the name of the device you created before and
            <span class="code">&lt;apikey&gt;</span> is the key you just created within the Google console (number 2
            within the image).
        </li>

        <li>Link andFHEM
            <ul>
                <li>Enter the andFHEM settings and enter the GCM project number (from the Google console page in section
                    "Overview") within the field "GCM Project Number".
                </li>
                <li>Refresh your xmllist and look for your GCMSend device you just created. Open the detail page and
                    click the button to register your device. Internally, andFHEM will add your device as regIds
                    attribute of your gcm device. <br/>
                    <a href="../images/installation/gcm/gcm_app.png"><img src="../images/installation/gcm/gcm_app.png"/></a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="client_side_certificates">Client Side Certificates</h2>


    <p>You can enforce your webserver to ask for a certificate. Only if the clients has access to the correct
        certificate, the webserver will allow access to the resource (<a
                href="http://wiki.cacert.org/ApacheServerClientCertificateAuthentication">details</a>).</p>

    <p>To configure andFHEM to use those certificates, you have to copy them to your Android device. Afterwards, startup
        the configuration screen of your FHEMWEB connection and scroll down. You will find a checkbox to enable client
        side certificates.</p>

    <p>Below that checkbox, there are two selectors for the respective certificates. The client certificate is expected
        to be in p12 format. The server certificate relates to the CA certificate and is expected to be in PEM format.
        Please note that only those certificate formats are supported. All other formats will fail to work in
        combination with andFHEM.</p>
